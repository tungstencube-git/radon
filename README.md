# FAQ 

- why would i use this over regular building from source - makes the building process easier and uses less bandwidth
- why is the install function not split into multiple files - lazy
- how does it function - clones repository checks for build system builds clones to /usr/local/bin or ~/.local/bin
- what wm are you using (yes ik my rice is very cool) - i3
- how does this compare to ubi - ubi installs binaries (like choccy) this builds from source
